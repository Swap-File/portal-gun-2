*ahrs-visualizer* reads orientation data on its standard input and uses that to display a 3D representation of the orientation.

Currently, the presence of GPU-specific code means that it only works on the "Raspberry Pi":http://www.raspberrypi.org/ but it can probably be ported to other boards.  It uses OpenGL ES 2.0.

This program runs fine from the console; you do not need to run X.

This program is meant to be used with "minimu9-ahrs":https://github.com/DavidEGrayson/minimu9-ahrs, a separate utility that reads data from the Pololu MinIMU-9 and computes its orientation.  To pipe direction cosine matrix (DCM) data from minimu9-ahrs to ahrs-visualizer, simply run the following command:

<pre><code>minimu9-ahrs | ahrs-visualizer</code></pre>

For documentation of the input data format that ahrs-visualizer expects, please see the documentation of the output format of minimu9-ahrs in its man page.

Understanding the visualization:

* The 3D model is a Pololu MinIMU-9 v2.
* The X axis is drawn as a red line.
* The Y axis is drawn as a green line.
* The Z axis is drawn as a blue line.
* The acceleration vector is drawn as a cyan line.
* The magnetic field vector is drawn as a yellow line.
